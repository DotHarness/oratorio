## 1. Product Goal and Boundaries

Oratorio supports GitLab issues and merge requests as source-backed Tasks with
the same Oratorio lifecycle, review rounds, AppServer dispatch, review draft
control, source write audit, and implementation delivery concepts that exist
for GitHub-backed work.

The integration must:

- preserve existing GitHub behavior and legacy GitHub-compatible routes;
- treat GitLab as a source provider with its own endpoint, credentials,
  project identity, webhook verification, diff anchors, commit status, and
  merge request semantics;
- support GitLab.com, self-managed GitLab, and Dedicated-style endpoint shapes;
- make GitHub and GitLab understandable side by side in Desktop Settings;
- keep every external write backend-owned, explicit, auditable, retryable, and
  separate from agent tool execution.

The integration must not:

- merge GitLab merge requests;
- silently approve GitLab merge requests;
- let agents push branches, create merge requests, or write source comments
  directly;
- require GitLab Premium or Ultimate for the baseline read/write flow;
- assume GitLab.com-only project or URL behavior;
- require OAuth browser connection setup for the baseline token flow.

---

## 2. Source Provider Model

Source integrations are provider-backed capabilities, not isolated GitHub or
GitLab code paths. Provider-specific behavior is adapted into shared Oratorio
concepts so Desktop, automation, review drafts, sync jobs, and source-write
audit can reason about multiple sources consistently.

### 2.1 Provider Capabilities

Each source provider exposes redacted capability status:

- provider id and display name;
- endpoint or instance identity;
- configured state;
- authentication state;
- read capability;
- write capability;
- webhook capability;
- configured source project count;
- last sync time;
- recent provider-specific failures.

Provider capability discovery must be visible to Desktop and diagnostics.
Unsupported actions fail with stable errors rather than being hidden or guessed.

Provider capabilities cover:

- **Read sync**: list source work, normalize it into Oratorio Tasks, preserve
  source snapshots, and isolate per-project failures.
- **Details hydrate**: load comments, review discussion context, diff metadata,
  and other source context that is too expensive or noisy for board sync.
- **Source write**: execute audited writes from Oratorio decisions, review
  drafts, implementation delivery, and external status updates.
- **Diff anchors**: validate structured review draft comments against the
  provider's changed-file and line-position model.
- **Git delivery**: push Oratorio-created implementation branches and create
  provider-native review targets.
- **Webhook**: verify inbound provider events and enqueue provider sync jobs.

### 2.2 Source Identity and Routing

Source-backed Tasks continue to store `source` plus `externalId`. GitHub legacy
values remain valid.

Source-neutral identity terms:

- **SourceProvider**: a configured external system, such as `github` or
  `gitlab`.
- **SourceInstance**: a provider endpoint host, such as `github.com`,
  `gitlab.com`, or `gitlab.company.test`.
- **SourceProject**: a provider repository/project path within an instance.
- **SourceProjectKey**: the canonical routing and allowlist key:

```text
<provider>:<instance>/<project-path>
```

Examples:

```text
github:github.com/dotharness/oratorio
gitlab:gitlab.com/group/subgroup/project
gitlab:gitlab.company.test/platform/tools/oratorio
```

Existing GitHub configuration and existing GitHub Tasks may continue to use
`owner/name`. New source-aware flows use canonical source project keys.
Desktop must display provider, instance, and project path separately enough
that identical GitHub and GitLab project paths are not ambiguous.

GitLab user-facing configuration uses the project path with namespace:

```text
group/project
group/subgroup/project
```

GitLab source external ids use the project-scoped `iid`, not GitLab's global
numeric object id:

```text
source = gitlab
externalId = issue:<instance>/<project-path>#<iid>
externalId = mr:<instance>/<project-path>!<iid>
```

The numeric GitLab project id may be cached as provider metadata after
resolution, but operators configure and route by project path.

Workspace routing accepts canonical source project keys and legacy GitHub
`owner/name` keys. Source-aware routing uses canonical keys internally.

### 2.3 Sync Jobs and Scheduling

Sync jobs are provider-scoped and project-scoped. A job records:

- provider;
- trigger;
- mode;
- status;
- total projects;
- completed and failed project counts;
- imported issue count;
- imported review target count;
- imported source comment count;
- skipped count;
- stable error code and message;
- project-level runs.

Canonical counters use `issuesImported`, `reviewTargetsImported`,
`commentsImported`, and `skipped`. GitHub-specific terms such as pull request
remain compatibility vocabulary only.

Allowed sync triggers are:

- `manual`;
- `webhook`;
- `scheduled`.

Scheduled sync is disabled by default. Enabling a schedule sets the first run
for `now + interval` and does not trigger immediate sync. Scheduled jobs run
incremental sync only. Full repair remains a manual operator action. If a
provider already has an active sync when its schedule is due, that active job
covers the schedule cycle and no duplicate job is queued. If Oratorio sleeps
through multiple intervals, it queues at most one catch-up job per provider.

### 2.4 Source Writes

Source writes use a source-neutral intent plus provider-specific payload model.
Canonical write intents include:

- source comment;
- review summary;
- inline review discussion;
- external status;
- local commit;
- branch push;
- review target creation;
- provider approval when explicitly supported.

Every source write is recorded before execution and remains retryable after
failure. Each record includes:

- provider;
- instance;
- project key;
- source item number or iid;
- head SHA when applicable;
- request JSON;
- response JSON;
- external id or URL;
- attempt count;
- stable error code and message.

GitHub compatibility names and payloads remain valid history. New provider-
neutral flows must reason from canonical intent rather than GitHub-only names.

---

## 3. GitLab Provider Contract

GitLab baseline setup uses token-based authentication. OAuth setup, automatic
webhook creation, production RBAC administration, and enterprise SSO are
separate product contracts.

### 3.1 Configuration and Authentication

GitLab configuration includes:

- provider enabled state;
- GitLab instance endpoint, defaulting to `https://gitlab.com`;
- configured project paths;
- one project profile per configured GitLab project;
- write enablement state;
- local-development webhook bypass state.

Each GitLab project profile is keyed by canonical project key:

```text
gitlab:<instance>/<group[/subgroup]/project>
```

The persisted profile data is `Oratorio:GitLab:ProjectProfiles[]` with:

- `Instance`;
- `ProjectPath`;
- `TokenKind`;
- write-only `Token`;
- optional write-only `WebhookSecret`;
- optional write-only `WebhookSigningToken`.

`TokenKind` is an operator-facing label, not a permission claim. The first
implementation supports exact project matching only. Group tokens or personal
tokens can be used by entering the same token in multiple project profiles;
there is no group-prefix inheritance.

The GitLab endpoint is the single operator-facing URL setting. The API URL is
derived as:

```text
<endpoint>/api/v4
```

Desktop must not ask the operator to separately configure an API base URL.
Legacy persisted `ApiBaseUrl` values may be read for compatibility, but runtime
behavior follows the endpoint-derived URL.

GitLab read access requires a project profile token that can read the target
project. GitLab write access requires a project profile token that can create
notes, discussions, statuses, push branches, and create merge requests for the
target project. The UI and diagnostics report token presence and observed
capability per project, but they must not claim a specific scope is present
unless a provider capability check has verified it.

GitLab writes happen as the target project profile's token identity. Operators
should prefer project access tokens for single-project automation and use group
or personal tokens only when broader access is intentional.

Legacy top-level `Oratorio:GitLab:Token`, `TokenKind`, `WebhookSecret`, and
`WebhookSigningToken` values remain runtime-only compatibility inputs. Runtime
uses them only when no project profiles exist at all. Settings does not show
legacy GitLab secret fields, does not auto-migrate them into project profiles,
and drops them on the next Settings save.

### 3.2 Read Sync

Configured projects are resolved independently. If one project fails to resolve
or sync, that project run fails with a stable error and does not block other
configured projects.

If at least one project profile exists but a configured project has no matching
profile token, that project fails read sync with
`gitlabProjectProfileTokenMissing`. Provider capability may still be `partial`
when at least one configured project remains readable.

GitLab issues import as Oratorio issues with:

- title;
- description;
- assignee;
- labels;
- web URL;
- source created and updated times;
- source lifecycle state;
- closed time when available;
- project key;
- source snapshot.

GitLab merge requests import as Oratorio review targets with:

- title;
- description;
- assignees and reviewers when useful to source context;
- labels;
- web URL;
- source branch;
- target branch;
- draft state;
- source created and updated times;
- source lifecycle state;
- closed or merged time when available;
- head SHA;
- diff refs when available;
- project key;
- source snapshot.

GitLab source state maps to Oratorio source state:

| GitLab state | Oratorio source state |
| --- | --- |
| `opened` | `open` |
| `closed` | `closed` |
| `merged` | `merged` |
| anything else | `unknown` |

Details hydrate loads source context that should not be part of every board
sync:

- issue notes;
- merge request notes;
- merge request discussions;
- relevant system notes;
- current merge request diff refs;
- current detailed merge status when available.

Imported source context uses source visibility and must not be treated as
Oratorio operator feedback.

Closed GitLab issues and closed or merged GitLab merge requests are archived
when no Oratorio run is active. If a source item reopens and the archive reason
was source-driven, Oratorio reopens it to `discovered`. Manual archive remains
operator-owned and must not be undone by GitLab sync.

### 3.3 Webhooks

GitLab webhooks enqueue provider sync jobs. They do not directly mutate Tasks.

Supported webhook verification modes:

- Standard Webhooks signing token verification when GitLab sends signing
  headers;
- legacy secret token verification through `X-Gitlab-Token`;
- disabled verification only when explicitly enabled for local development.

Webhook verification is selected from the profile matching the webhook payload's
project path. Signing headers are verified first when present, then
`X-Gitlab-Token` is checked. Missing profile secrets reject with `403`. The
local unsafe bypass remains a provider-level local-development setting.

Supported event families include issues, merge requests, notes, and pushes.
Events outside configured projects are ignored with an audit-visible diagnostic
when feasible.

### 3.4 Decisions, Review Drafts, and Statuses

GitLab write capability is available only when:

- GitLab is configured;
- writes are enabled;
- the target project is configured;
- the target project has a project profile token;
- the target Task is GitLab-backed and has a valid project path plus iid.

If a gate fails, Oratorio records a failed source write with a stable error.
Task decision state and review draft state are not rolled back.

Decision write mapping:

| Oratorio item | Operator action | GitLab write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Issue | `approve`, `requestChanges`, or `reject` | issue note |
| Merge request | `approve` | MR note plus commit status `success` |
| Merge request | `requestChanges` | MR note plus commit status `failed` |
| Merge request | `reject` | MR note plus commit status `failed` |
| Merge request | `reReview` | no GitLab write |
| Local task | any decision | no external source write |

The commit status name is:

```text
oratorio/review
```

The status target SHA is the current GitLab merge request head SHA. If no head
SHA is available, the status write fails independently; a note write may still
succeed as a separate audited write.

GitLab MR Approval API is not part of the baseline. If later enabled, it must
be a separate explicit provider capability because eligibility, tier support,
password re-authentication, and author/committer restrictions vary by GitLab
configuration.

Review Draft submission remains source-neutral. GitLab-specific behavior
happens during validation and publication.

GitLab diff anchor validation uses current merge request diff metadata:

- `base_sha`;
- `start_sha`;
- `head_sha`;
- old path and new path;
- old line or new line.

Oratorio draft side maps as:

| Oratorio side | GitLab position |
| --- | --- |
| `RIGHT` | `new_line` |
| `LEFT` | `old_line` |

For renamed files, validation uses both old path and new path. For new files,
only new-side anchors are valid. For deleted files, only old-side anchors are
valid. Invalid comments are skipped with warnings and must never be published
as misleading overview notes.

Publication rules:

- summary-only drafts publish as one merge request note;
- each accepted inline finding creates one GitLab-visible discussion or draft
  note;
- suggestion replacements are emitted only when GitLab can render them safely
  and the target anchor is on the new side of the diff;
- multi-line suggestion replacements use GitLab's offset-aware suggestion fence
  form (`suggestion:-N+M`) so a discussion anchored at the final new-side line
  can cover preceding changed lines;
- accepted comment-only findings omit suggestion fences and carry their
  `commentOnlyReason` in Oratorio for operator audit;
- every source write links back to the Oratorio draft;
- successful publication makes the draft immutable;
- failed publication leaves the draft retryable.

Draft auto-publish is allowed only when:

- the project is in the provider-specific publish allowlist;
- the draft has no warnings or skipped comments;
- current MR head SHA matches the reviewed head SHA;
- write capability is available;
- diff refs are current.

Auto-publish never approves, requests changes, merges, closes, resolves the
Oratorio Task, or resolves GitLab discussions.

### 3.5 Implementation Delivery

GitLab implementation delivery is eligible when:

- the run purpose is `implementation`;
- the item is a GitLab issue or an Oratorio local task;
- the item is not a GitLab merge request;
- the item has or can infer exactly one GitLab source project route;
- GitLab writes are enabled;
- the target GitLab project has a project profile token;
- managed worktrees are enabled and the run has a ready managed worktree;
- the managed worktree has a non-empty diff;
- the delivery policy permits manual delivery or automatic review target
  delivery.

GitLab merge requests remain review targets. They must not be mutated by
implementation runs.

Delivery flow:

1. Verify eligibility and clear prior delivery errors.
2. Compute changed files from the managed worktree.
3. Create a local commit with the operator-reviewed commit message.
4. Push the current HEAD to a GitLab branch under the Oratorio branch namespace.
5. Create a GitLab merge request with the operator-reviewed title and body.
6. Upsert the generated merge request as a GitLab-backed Oratorio Task.
7. Link the generated merge request to the originating issue or local task.
8. Mark the implementation draft delivered.

Each side effect has a source write record:

- local commit;
- branch push;
- review target creation.

If a later step fails, completed prior write records remain succeeded and the
draft records the failed step. Retry re-validates current state and must not
duplicate source-visible objects when a prior audit record identifies an
existing pushed branch or merge request.
Implementation delivery retry is step-aware: if the local commit or branch push
already succeeded, Oratorio reuses those audit records and retries only the
remaining review target creation step. Retrying the failed review target
creation source write follows the same delivery retry path rather than the
generic note/status source-write retry path.

GitLab merge request creation uses:

- source branch: the Oratorio-generated implementation branch;
- target branch: the Task branch when present, otherwise the provider project's
  default branch when known, otherwise `main`;
- title: operator-reviewed proposed PR/MR title;
- description: operator-reviewed proposed body plus origin reference when
  available;
- draft state: false by default unless a later policy explicitly introduces
  draft merge requests.

Generated merge requests start as `discovered` review targets. Approving the
originating implementation Task accepts the handoff; it does not approve or
merge the generated merge request.

Delivery failures surface stable errors for missing route, ambiguous local-task
route, missing credentials, invalid managed worktree, empty diff, invalid
branch name, local commit failure, branch push failure, GitLab merge request
creation failure, generated Task upsert conflict, and insufficient token
permission.

## 4. Desktop Settings and Operator UX

Settings uses a provider/project mental model rather than a GitHub-only
repository mental model.

Required sections:

- **Sources**: provider cards for GitHub and GitLab with configuration status,
  sync status, scheduled sync controls, read/write capability, webhook posture,
  last sync, current progress, and latest failure.
- **Projects**: source project routing cards with provider, instance, project
  path, canonical key, DotCraft workspace path, workspace health, and GitLab
  project profile fields when the route is GitLab.
- **Credentials**: provider-specific endpoint, write toggle, local webhook
  bypass, and redacted diagnostics.
- **Review**: provider-aware Auto Review and Draft auto-publish allowlists.
- **Worktree**: shared runtime policy copy that applies to GitHub, GitLab, and
  local tasks.

Provider-specific copy must use provider language:

- GitHub: repository and PR;
- GitLab: project and MR;
- source-neutral surfaces: project and review target.

Provider cards include scheduled sync controls with:

- enabled switch;
- common interval presets;
- custom interval input;
- next-run state;
- latest schedule failure.

The schedule switch is disabled when read capability is unavailable and
explains that read sync must be configured first. Background schedule failures
stay inside the corresponding provider card and must not create global toast
noise.

Project routing cards include:

- provider selector;
- instance label;
- source project path;
- canonical source project key;
- DotCraft workspace path;
- workspace health;
- browse-folder affordance;
- validation and restart-required state.

For GitHub projects, Project routing also shows installation profiles grouped
by GitHub instance and owner. A profile may be detected from the GitHub App or
entered manually; repositories under the same owner share the profile.

Credential UX rules:

- GitLab endpoint is the only URL field shown for GitLab API configuration;
- GitLab token, webhook secret, and signing token fields live on GitLab project
  routing cards, not in provider-level Credentials;
- profile secrets are submitted once and never echoed back;
- profile token, webhook secret, and signing token fields use one-shot replace,
  clear, and unchanged semantics;
- removing a configured GitLab project removes its profile secrets from the next
  Configuration Overlay save;
- changing the GitLab endpoint host clears old project profiles and requires
  new profiles for the new instance;
- write capability is separate from read capability;
- saved configuration changes require an Oratorio server restart unless a
  later hot-reload contract is added.

Review and automation UX:

- Auto Review allowlists list configured source projects and remain provider
  aware.
- Draft auto-publish allowlists explain the provider-specific publish route.
- Auto-publish never approves, merges, or resolves Tasks.
- Implementation delivery copy should say "Auto PR/MR" or source-neutral
  "delivery" when both GitHub and GitLab are present.

---

## 5. Diagnostics, Security, and Operations

Diagnostics must include redacted GitLab status:

- endpoint and derived API URL without userinfo, query, or fragment;
- provider-level and per-project token presence, not token values;
- read capability;
- write capability;
- webhook verification mode;
- configured projects;
- last sync time;
- recent sync failures;
- recent source write failures.

Secrets must never be returned in plaintext through settings, diagnostics,
audits, timeline events, sync logs, or source write logs. Configuration writes
create durable redacted audit records. Unknown provider fields fail validation
with stable errors.

Operational documentation must cover:

- GitLab token choices and recommended minimum scopes;
- GitLab.com and self-managed endpoint setup;
- project path and subgroup examples;
- webhook setup and verification modes;
- commit status merge-gate setup;
- known limits around MR approvals and request-changes semantics;
- troubleshooting sync, permission, and delivery failures.

---

## 6. Compatibility and Migration

GitHub compatibility is mandatory:

- existing GitHub config remains readable and writable;
- existing GitHub routes continue to work;
- existing GitHub item identities are not rewritten;
- existing board filters that use `source=github` continue to work;
- existing source write audit records remain valid;
- existing Desktop Settings routes may redirect to source-aware sections.

GitLab configuration migration is non-destructive:

- project paths are normalized without truncating subgroups;
- canonical GitLab project keys include provider and instance;
- legacy or stale GitLab API base URL fields do not override the endpoint-
  derived runtime API URL;
- legacy top-level GitLab token, webhook secret, and signing token values are
  honored only until the next Settings save when no project profiles exist;
- Settings saves write only `ProjectProfiles[]` for new GitLab credentials and
  intentionally drop legacy top-level GitLab secrets;
- workspace routes and automation allowlists should migrate when a GitLab
  endpoint change alters the canonical instance key.

Any schema migration must preserve source snapshots, source write logs, review
drafts, implementation drafts, timeline history, and audit history. Recovery
from a bad migration is through backup restore, not destructive downgrade.

---

## 7. Validation Expectations

Validation must cover the provider contract and GitLab-specific behavior with
provider fakes before credentialed smoke tests.

Required coverage:

- provider capability reporting and diagnostics redaction;
- GitHub compatibility after source-neutral extraction;
- canonical project keys for GitHub, GitLab.com, and self-managed GitLab;
- GitLab subgroup project path normalization;
- GitLab project profile validation, redaction, encrypted persistence, legacy
  runtime fallback, and drop-on-save behavior;
- GitLab read sync for issues, merge requests, labels, assignees, draft MRs,
  closed issues, merged MRs, and paginated results;
- partial provider behavior where profiled projects sync/write and missing-
  profile projects fail with stable project-level errors;
- details hydrate for GitLab notes and discussions;
- webhook verification for per-project secret tokens, per-project signing
  tokens, missing profile rejection, and legacy old-config verification;
- source write audit and retry for GitLab notes, discussions, draft notes, and
  commit statuses;
- review draft publish, implementation delivery, and branch push selecting the
  token for the target GitLab project only;
- diff anchor validation for GitLab old/new line semantics, renamed files, new
  files, and deleted files;
- review draft publication, single-line and multi-line suggestion fences,
  comment-only findings, and auto-publish gates;
- implementation delivery failures for missing credentials, missing route,
  ambiguous route, empty diff, push failure, merge request creation failure,
  stale target branch, and insufficient token permission;
- Desktop Settings states for GitHub-only, GitLab-only, both providers,
  unconfigured provider, read-only configuration, scheduled sync states,
  restart required, failed sync, schedule failure, failed write, GitLab
  project-card profile editing, endpoint host-change profile clearing,
  partial/missing profile status, and redacted credentials.

Manual credentialed smoke tests should cover at least one GitLab.com project
and one self-managed-compatible endpoint shape before the feature is marked
ready.

---

## 8. Assumptions and Defaults

- GitLab baseline setup is token-based.
- GitLab MR Approval API is deferred until explicitly modeled as a separate
  provider capability.
- GitLab external comments are written by the configured token identity.
- GitLab merge-gate-compatible external signal uses commit status checks.
- GitLab project path is the primary operator-facing identifier.
- Numeric GitLab project id is cached metadata, not user-facing configuration.
- Review Draft publication may create multiple GitLab discussions for one
  Oratorio draft.
- Auto Review for GitLab follows the same first-enable baseline and head-SHA
  re-review policy as GitHub after read sync is available.
- Full repair is manual only and is not scheduled.
